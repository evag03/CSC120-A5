- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affects your programming?

Association is helpful for when you're trying to figure out how to connect parts of your code across classes, which is really difficult to grasp at first when you're making the jump to Java. It tells you what parts of your code are important for other parts and where you can tinker with or cut out overly complex parts of your program without breaking other parts of your code.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
 
 We learned that using getters was the most important tool for allowing methods and variables to cross classes and working around that seemed virtually impossible. I'd recommend making a blueprint of sorts and designating what methods have relationships with others. Then, connecting the methods with eachother and figuring out how they're connected (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many, etc). It's tempting to wait until you get to the Train class to connect everything, but having an idea of where the everything intersects outside of the Train class ahead of time makes the whole process easier and faster so by the time you get to the Train class, it's extremely clear how to tie everything together.
